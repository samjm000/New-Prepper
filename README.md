Clinic Prepper.

To speed up clinic prep. 

Place this program in a folder wherever you desire. 

Within the program folder:
clinic lists should reside in a folder called "clinic lists"
prepped clinics should reside in a folder called "prepped clinics"

The excel file should take the form  - 
TIME, CHI, FNAME, LNAME

Hopefully the rest is self explanatory! :)
